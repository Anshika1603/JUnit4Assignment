# JUnit4Assignment

Question:
Create a JUnit4 test class called "StringUtilsTest". This test class should test the basic functionality of a simple StringUtils class that has the following methods:

    reverse(String str): returns the reverse of the input string - Implement this method yourself
    isEmpty(String str): returns true if the input string is empty, false otherwise - Implement this method yourself
    isPalindrome(String str): returns true if the input string is a palindrome, false otherwise - Implement this method yourself

Your "StringUtilsTest" class should have three test methods, one for each StringUtils method. Each test method should test the following scenarios:

    Test the method with a non-empty string
    Test the method with an empty string

For the isPalindrome() method, you should also test the following scenario:

    Test the method with a palindrome string
    Test the method with a non-palindrome string

For each scenario, you should check that the correct result is returned by the StringUtils method. You should also add at least one assertion for each scenario to ensure that the method is behaving correctly.
